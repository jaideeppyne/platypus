/**
 * When the sidebar's chat list has to re-read itself (issue #853).
 *
 * The list is the sidebar's own SWR cache, and a chat row is created
 * server-side when its first run starts — after the list was last fetched. So
 * a brand-new chat is invisible until something asks for the list again, and
 * the only thing that used to ask was the open chat announcing its title
 * transition. Navigate away mid-stream, or let titling fail, and the row never
 * showed up at all.
 *
 * {@link chatListPoll} is the whole decision, taken as one: it answers how long
 * until the next read and which chats are still being waited on, because the
 * second feeds the first. All three reasons to poll clear themselves, so the
 * steady state — every chat terminal and titled, nothing being waited on —
 * issues no repeating request:
 *
 * - **A chat is running.** The per-chat spinner is rendered off this list and
 *   nothing else tells it a run ended.
 * - **A chat we expect is missing.** Opening a chat route puts its id in the
 *   URL before the row exists, so "the route names a chat the list has never
 *   heard of" is the signal that one is on its way. It is remembered rather
 *   than re-read off the route each time, because the user may leave before
 *   the row lands — and given up on after {@link MISSING_CHAT_WATCH_MS},
 *   because a chat page opened and never sent from creates no row at all.
 * - **A recent chat is still "Untitled".** Titling is fire-and-forget after
 *   the run reaches a terminal state, so the title lands after the poll for
 *   `running` has already stopped. Bounded by {@link UNTITLED_CHAT_WATCH_MS}
 *   off the row's own `updatedAt`, so a chat whose titling failed settles as
 *   "Untitled" instead of polling forever.
