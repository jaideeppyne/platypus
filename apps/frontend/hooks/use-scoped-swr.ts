 * A GET through the request module: the same base-URL-and-signed-in-user
 * gate and Organization-vs-Workspace path shape `writeEntity` already owns
 * for writes, resolved once instead of as a repeated
 * `backendUrl && user ? joinUrl(...) : null` at every read call site.
 * `scope: null` (rather than a boolean `enabled`) lets a caller withhold the
 * fetch for the same reason it can't yet name a scope — e.g. a dialog that
 * hasn't opened, or an id that hasn't resolved.
 *
 * `config.fetcher` swaps the reader for one read — `optionalFetcher` for a row
 * that may not exist yet (issue #648). Absent one, every read keeps `fetcher`'s
 * contract, where any non-OK response is an error.
